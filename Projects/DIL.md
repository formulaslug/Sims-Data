# Driver in Loop Simulation

## Active Members

## Design Review Dates/Timeline
1. PDR by November 4th
1. Visualization of hardcoded inputs by end of fall quarter
1. Dynamic loading and inputs by end of winter quarter

## Introduction
The driver in loop simulation is a video game that helps train drivers
and setup the vehicle before taking it to the track and using valuable
testing time. The main goal should be to provide the driver with a
general feel for the vehicle by providing visual response to things
like handling and force feedback. 

## Overview of the Problem
This project has the lowest optimization requirements of any project
on the software team, but still must be able to run in real time. The
project should include a visualization that is 3D, but does not need
to be hyperrealistic and instead should provide sufficient realism to
get a feel for the car, likely at bluemax. It should integrate the
existing vehicle dynamics simulations directly and have them respond
to inputs given by the driver.

## Steps in the project
1. PDR to decide frameworks and libraries
1. Implementation of a 3d visualization system
1. Loading scenes and vehicle setups into the simulation
1. Full integration of the VD sim
1. Testing

## Suggested direction
- choose libraries for visualizations
