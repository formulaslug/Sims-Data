# Laptime simulation

## Active Members
1. Krish Aggarwal

## Design Review Dates/Timeline
- Completed by beginning of winter quarter with easy extensability

## Introduction
Laptime simulations allow us to get an easy estimate of a theoretical max
performance of the vehicle based on changes to the car's parameters
that we easily understand.

## Overview of the Problem
The problem is generally a large optimization problem that involves
understanding how different vehicle inputs will affect the car's
movement. It must involve annotating a given track with corners and
straights and then parsing the data effectively to understand how to
take each feature on the track as effectively as possible.

## Steps in the project
1. Understand the current state of the simulations
2. Develop visualization tools 
3. Develop laptime simulations
4. Validate against actual data for if manauevers are possible.

## Suggested direction
- Begin by understanding the current input/output format of the
  simulation
  - Create base level assumptions on how to create effective
    optimizations
	- Literature review on existing work on laptime simulations
