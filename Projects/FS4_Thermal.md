## Introduction

Thermal modeling of the tractive battery can help us estimate heat generation and therefore the amount of cooling we need and how long we can drive.

## Overview of the Problem

Please read more about introduction and overview of the problem in this [doc page](../Docs/Battery%20Modeling.md)

## Steps in the project

1. Determine a thermal model for FS-4 using the equations and readings
1. Develop a plan for a PDR

## Suggested direction

1. Using the equations, figure out how much energy (or really power) the tractive battery releases as heat as a function of current.
1. Determine how much the temperature rises over an endurance run relative to how much it actually increased.
1. Using the rest of the equations, determine cooling as a function of difference in temp, fans, and with the heat equations.
