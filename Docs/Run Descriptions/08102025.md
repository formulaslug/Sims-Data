### Nathaniel Notes

Notes from testing today:
- Regular IMD faults when turning off TS. Tends to flicker. Latching logic wasn't working for it as well. Light on the dash flickers without latching. Assumption why it happened is that the capacitor that dictates its output came loose during driving
- Blew up the LV supply because the voltage input went unswitched before plugging it into 208 or 240V AC
- Estop button came loose (was only soldered, not proper crimps or connectors). 
- BMS had some critical lines wrong and commented out that led to some unfortunate battery stuff
- Dash kind of randomly doesn't work. Flickering dash, sometimes just doesn't work at all in random situations.
Known issue that without an SD card the dash never boots up. 
- LV battery died (lowest ~5 V). Recharged back to 13.4 and settled ~13.3
