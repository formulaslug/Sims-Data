# How to make a run description

Create a copy of the markdown template file in this folder titled the date in ```MMDDYYYY``` format (eg. ```08102025```). Fill out the required information, and then for every single log that is taken off the car, write a small description detailing what you believe happened during this run. The more detail the better.
